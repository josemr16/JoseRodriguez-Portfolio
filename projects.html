			<span class="motives">Description:</span>

			<ul>

				
				<li>
					Implemented a Full Stack JavaScript application that allows restaurants to make posts about foods that will get thrown away. They can sell the dish for a reduced price.
				</li>

				<li>
					Users can sign up to view the food available, make a reservation and then proceed to pick it up at the restaurant location.
				</li>

				<li>
					Utilized React.js and CSS for the frontend, Node + Express for the backend and PostgreSQL for the database.
				</li>

				<li>
					Accessed liberties and packages including knex.js to connect database with backend, Bootstrap and Tachyons to style the frontend, and body-parser as middleware for the backend.
				</li>
				
			</ul>

			<span class="motives" >Reasons:</span>

			<ul>

				<li>
					According to USDA's Economic Research Service food waste is estimated at between 30 - 40 percent of the food supply.
				</li>

				<li>
					31% is approximately 133 billion pounds and 161 billion dollars worth of food.
				</li>

				<li>
					Restaurant food waste amounts to 2 billion in lost profits.
				</li>
				
			</ul>

			<span class="motives">Interest:</span>
			<ul>
				
				<li>
					Reduce food waste.
				</li>

				<li>
					Decrease restaurant profit loss.
				</li>

				<li>
					Connect people with amazing meals for an affordable price.
				</li>

			</li>
			<hr>

			<span class="motives" >Description:</span>

			<ul>

				<li>
					Implemented a HTML and CSS website which shows customers the location, memberships and benefits of a supermarket.
					
				</li>

				<li>
					Included hyperlinks, navigation buttons, and applied box model properties to design the website.
				</li>

				<li>
					Added a gradient background and hover effect for buttons on the website.
				</li>
				
			</ul>

			<span class="motives" >Reason:</span>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I used to work at a supermarket and many times they wanted to have a form of perks and rewards for the costumers, but they needed a way other than just giving away flyers to show costumers how the perks and rewards would work.
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			

			<span class="motives">Interest:</span>

			<ul>
				
				<li>
				I created Jose’s Market as a template website so that supermarkets can see it and reach out to me if they wanted to have a similar website to show their perks and rewards program.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<li class="projects-name">
				<a href="https://github.com/josemr16/newtonmethod" target="_blank">Newton's Method</a>
			</li>
			<hr>

			<span class="motives">Description:</span>

			<ul>

				<li>
					Built a Python program which allowed users to input an equation and an approximation of the solution.
				</li>

				<li>
					Programmed a method to find the derivative of the user’s given equation, using strings, loops, and lists.
				</li>

				<li>
					Accessed list indexing, string slicing, if else statements and exception handling.
				</li>

				
			</ul>

			<span class="motives">Reason:</span>

			<ul>
				<li>
					In the majority of Math courses that I have taken, I had to utilize Newton’s method to help me get to the next step of a mathematical problem and it would take me a long time to manually compute it.
				</li>
				

			</ul>

			<span class="motives">Interest:</span>

			<ul>
				
				<li>
					The program helped me quickly compute the Newton’s Method making my math problems easier than before.
				</li>

			</ul>
